# CougarCS-Web

CougarCS-Web is the revamp version of the current cougarcs.com website.

Check old repo [https://github.com/CougarCS/CougarCS-Client](here).

## Purpose:

Current website is outdated, with our new design we drive members to a better user experience and a more aesthetic site that will drive our purpose to be the best CS organization at the University of Houston.
